# AudioVisualiser


This audio visualiser uses Brownian noise to generate an array of values that are plotted onto a mesh shape to create a random terrain map. An fft analyser is used to distort the mesh based on the amplitude of frequencies from the system microphone.

Uses p5.js, p5.sound.js, p5.gui libraries.
